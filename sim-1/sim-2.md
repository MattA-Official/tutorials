# Your First Software Type

To begin, create a folder for your mod. Inside that folder create a folder called `SoftwareTypes`. This is where your software will go.

Create a file called `MyFirstSoftware.tyd`, open it in a text editor \(we recommend [VScode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)\). You are now ready to begin.

More information about each of the elements can be found in [this table](https://softwareinc.coredumping.com/wiki/index.php/Data_Modding#Elements) on the official wiki.

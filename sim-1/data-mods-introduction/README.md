## TyD

TyD is an easy-to-edit text data language designed for:

* **Game data** like enemy types, spells, terrain types, and so on.
* **User config data** like screen resolution, difficulty, and user accounts.

In _Software Inc._ TyD is used for **software types**, **company types** and **employee personalities**. For more information about TyD refer to the [official specification](https://github.com/TynanSylvester/TyD).

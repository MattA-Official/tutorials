# Preview Images

> WIM-3

Preview Images are the first thing you ever see of a Workshop Item:

![Square Preview image Example](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%283%29.png)

![Screen Preview Image Example](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%284%29.png)

Preview Images come in two formats, square, and screen.

Square preview images must keep a 1:1 Aspect ratio and be atleast 512px by 512px

Screen preview images must keep a 4:3 Aspect ratio and be atleast 1920x1080 for correct sizing.

For Square preview images, its best to grab a screenshot of your mod up close, or if its not visible in-game, text can suffice.

For Screen preview images, try and get as much in as possible, adding banners, descriptions etc. If its not visible in-game, a small title with a sub-title can suffice.

A list of Software you can create preview images with:

* [Paint.Net](https://www.getpaint.net/download.html) \(Windows\)

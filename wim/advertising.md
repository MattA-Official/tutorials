{% hint style="danger" %}
Advertise at your own risk, make sure to follow the rules of wherever you are advertising.
{% endhint %}

This page won't give you any info, just a list of places you could advertise:

* Reddit - Most games have a reddit page, if advertising mods isn't stated in the rules, you are probably more than welcome to.
* Discord - Most games have a modding channel on their discord, if advertising isn't stated in the server's rules, you will probably be more than welcome to show your mod off. Discord Invites are a no-no when advertising on Discord.
* Steam - Create a discussion post on a steam forum, since steam forums are rarely moderated \(but I am not asking you to break the rules\), you can post discord invites, screenshots galore.

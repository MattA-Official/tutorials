# Descriptions

> wim-2

Did you know that only 45% of steam workshop users read the description? If you think about it. There are **20.31 million** steam users that play daily. Which means only 9,139,500 players actually check the description.

This may seem a lot, but that's all the games on steam combined.

When players do read the description, its usually because they are interested in the mod, something catches their eye or they want more information.

### Catching Eyes

_Now that may sound like something from a horror film, I'm sorry but I couldn't find a better name for it ha._

"Catching Eyes" is the means of making people look at things because they saw something moving, something shiny or something attractive.

Most users look in the description if there is a animated gif;

Here are some examples:

{% tab title="Example 1" %}
![](../.gitbook/assets/836328862_preview_836188351_preview_299432961_preview_like.gif)
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Example 2" %}
![](../.gitbook/assets/1513929659_test.gif)
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

Catchy right?

### Informational

Most people view the description for information. The first 5 lines of the description must not have any BBCode or formatting as BBCode is visible when the user hovers over the item:

Its best to place a TL:DR \(Too Long Didn't Read\).

#### What is a TL:DR?

A TL:DR is a short sentence that summarises a large paragraph, usually they go at the bottom of the page, but for description purposes, they go at the top.

#### Do's and Don'ts

| **Do** | Don't |
| :---: | :---: |
| Add a TL:DR at the top of your page. | Use BBCode formatting at the top of your page. |
| Use picture banners to separate parts of the description. | Create the entire description using images. |
| Use lists, headings with BBCode to allow users to understand the description. | Use the wrong BBCode Tags for the wrong purpose. |

# Sending in "Work" tasks

> OTW-3

Once every few pages, there will be a small "Work" task you can complete. These tasks are completely optional but aid your learning experience.

The "Work" will state what is required, what tools you will need and a small hint of how to complete it. The "Work" will also have an ID, keep this safe as you will need it when creating an issue on the GitHub with the work files.

The work ID is the top greyed out text inside the "Work" box, work IDs go along this format:

```text
{Track Tag}-{Page Number}-[Page Part-]W
```

Once you have completed the "Work" task, put the files into a .zip and [create an issue on GitHub.](https://github.com/OE-O/tutorials/issues/new/choose)

We will review the tasks you have uploaded and give you a grade from zero to ten, with zero being its ~~shit~~ nothing to do with the task and ten being its perfect.

#### Example:

> Example taken from SCM-5

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Work" %}
> SCM-5-W

Create a Node.js script like the one you saw above that copies c\# files \(.cs\) into a DLLMod folder.

#### You will need:

* A code editor, preferably Visual Studio Code or Atom.
* Node.js [\(You can find a download here\)](https://nodejs.org)

#### Requirements to get a ten:

* Use under 3 lines.
* Copy only C\# files \(.cs\) and nothing else.
* Explain how it works.

#### What to upload:

* A screenshot of the C\# files in a DLLMod folder.
* Upload the .js script in a zip.

#### How to:

1. Create a JavaScript file and write the script inside, try your best to aim for a ten using the requirements.
2. Open a terminal where the script is located and run the following command, replacing scriptFile with the name of the script:

```bash
node (scriptFile).js
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="OTW" %}
If you are following the track "OTW".

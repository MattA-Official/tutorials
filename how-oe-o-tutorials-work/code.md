# Code

> OTW-2

We will never give you a fully completed piece of code - with exceptions.

We always use code screenshots instead of code blocks, this means you have to read the code instead of copy and pasting.

If you are wondering what we use, we use [PolaCode ](https://github.com/octref/polacode)

#### Example

> Example taken from SCM

You can easily separate your c\# files and copy them to a DLLMod folder using a simple nodejs script.

This script will copy all files with the file extension of `.txt` into the "anotherFolder" folder.

![Code snippet from script.js](../.gitbook/assets/example-code-otw2.png)

Try and modify this script or create your own that filters files ending with `.cs` and copies them into your DLLMod folder.

Once you've completed the script. You can run it using node.

[You can download node from here.](https://nodejs.org/en/)

# Basics

> OTW-1

**OE-O Tutorials** are linked via a **track-based system.**

Every **tutorial chapter** has a small tag at the top of the page, you can see this page is currently marked as the following: `OTW-1` 

The tags are formatted like the following:

{% hint style="info" %}
Curved brackets usually represent a required variable whilst square tags are optional variables.
{% endhint %}

```text
{Track Tag}-{Page Number}-[Page Part]
```

At the bottom of each page, there are two buttons automatically made by GitBook, these buttons will take you to the previous and next page. Above those buttons, **you can find a tab table** that shows you which page is next depending on **what tag is at the top of the page**.

### Example:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="OTW" %}
If you are following the track "OTW".

#### Previous page: _This is the first page on the track._

#### Next page:[ OTW-2 Code](otw-2.md)
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}
